# Palindrome-Checker-in-Hodor-language

A project to check whether a number, a word or even a sentence (in all lowercase/uppercase with punctuations removed) is a palindrome or not through this prompt box, but here's the twist: I attempted to convert my JavaScript file into a Hodor file ( a very non-mainstream programming language!)

# Hodor Language:

Hodor is an actively used esoteric programming language (also called: esolang) created in 2015. It primarily uses jumbled permutations of the word, "hodor", over and over again. So, Game of Thrones fans, REJOICE!

Useful links:

[Hodor's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hummingbirdtech/hodor)

[Somewhere on Internet](https://codelani.com/languages/hodor.html#:~:text=hodor%20is%20an%20actively%20used,it%20easier%20than%20ever%20before.)

However, here's a guide you can refer to:

## Installation
To install Hodor please make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- `npm install -g hodor-lang`

## Features
1. Hodor
2. Hodor hodor hodor hodor
3. Hodor hodor hodor 
4. Hodor HODOR hodor
5. Hodor!

## Hello World
The classic Hello World example is made easy with Hodor.

```javascript
$HODOR: hhodor? Hodor!? Hodor!? oHooodorrhodor orHodor!? d = HoDoRHoDoR () {
  hodor.hod('Hhodor? Hodor!? Hodor!? o HODOR!? orHodor!? d!');
};

hhodor? Hodor!? Hodor!? oHooodorrhodor orHodor!? d();
```

Now run the hello world example.

```bash
hodor tests/helloworld.hd
HODOR: \-> tests/helloworld.hd
HODOR!
```


## js2hd
To hit the ground running, you can convert your old JavaScript files to Hodor using the js2hd tool.
`js2hd myfile.js` -> `myfile.hd`



# About my code:

Firstly, I implemented the logic for checking Palindrome to build a Palindrome checker which takes user input through a prompt box and then provides output on screen as either of the following two:

1- It is a palindrome: if the input string is a palindrome

2- It is not a palindrome: if otherwise

Example:

However, I decided to convert my JavaScript file to a Hodor file by using the js2hd tool which resulted in the creation of Palindrome.hd file containing the Palindrome.js equivalent code but in Hodor script.
